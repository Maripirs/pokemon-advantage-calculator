# 👾 GA Project 2 - Pokemon Advantage Calculator 👾
##### By Maripi Bartosch and David Lee
###### Link here

## ⭐ Getting Started ⭐
Welcome to the Pokémon Advantage Calculator! User's can navigate to the Battle Page or the PokeDex. <br>
<br>
The Battle Page provides 2 Pokémon (original 151) at random and compares them in an advantage calculator. The calculator is dependent on the score, which is generated depending on the defending Pokemon's type against the attacking Pokemon's move type. User's can click the results button to see which Pokémon is at an advantage. <br>
<br>
The PokeDex provides all names, ID, and types of the original 151 Pokémon included in the calculator.

All Pokémon information is provided by PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/

## 🤔 Why a Pokemon Advantage Calculator? 🤔
Project 2 challenged us to create an interactive React application that included data from a third-party API, with 4 different components used. We thought it was a good opportunity to practice our skills using a straight forward API, so why not make a game out of the API data?<br>
<br>
🙌 We were able use the API to 🙌:<br>
<br>
✅Create an advantage calculator<br>
✅Style our app depending on API data<br>
✅Map through data to display information and imagery<br>
✅Sharpen our React and API skills
