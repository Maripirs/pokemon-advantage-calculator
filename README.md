# 👾 GA Project 2 - Pokémon Advantage Calculator 👾
##### By Maripi Bartosch and David Lee
###### [Pokémon Advantage Calculator](https://davipi.netlify.app/)

## ⭐ Getting Started ⭐
Welcome to the Pokémon Advantage Calculator! User's can navigate to the Battle Page or the PokeDex. <br>
<br>
The Battle Page provides 2 Pokémon (original 151) at random and compares them in an advantage calculator. The calculator is dependent on the score, which is generated depending on the defending Pokemon's type against the attacking Pokemon's move type. User's can click the results button to see which Pokémon is at an advantage. <br>
<br>
The PokeDex provides all names, ID, and types of the original 151 Pokémon included in the calculator.

All Pokémon information is provided by PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/ <br><br>

## 🤔 Why a Pokemon Advantage Calculator? 🤔
Project 2 challenged us to create an interactive React application that included data from a third-party API, with 4 different components used. We thought it was a good opportunity to practice our skills using a straight forward API, so why not make a game out of the API data?<br><br>

We were able use the API to:<br>

✅ Create an advantage calculator<br>
✅ Style our app depending on API data<br>
✅ Map through data to display information and imagery<br>
✅ Sharpen our React and API skills<br><br>

## ⏭️ Whats next? ⏭️
Here are a few stretch goals we look to accomplish in the future:<br>

📄 Function for users to generate random Pokémon as many times as they wish before comparing them<br>
📄 Include how the different Pokémon types compare to each other<br>
📄 Ability to choose which specific Pokémon is compared<br>
📄 Let the user choose which moves the Pokémon have<br>
📄 Giving the app a responsive design<br>
